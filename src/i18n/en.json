In response to challengers who prodded Thales that if Thales was such a famous philosopher then how could he be impoverished, Thales leveraged his knowledge of the seasons and the stars into profitable actions. Thales bought the right to use all the olive presses in town at a very low price in the winter. Several months later, there was a bountiful olive harvest. Thales earned a killing renting out the olive presses to people willing to pay a much higher price than what Thales paid for the rights to use the olive presses.",

Alice acquires sOPT-LONG tokens to benefit if Ether’s price exceeds $2,500 at the end of the week. If Ether’s price is strictly greater than $2,500.00 at the time of expiry, Alice’s sOPT-LONG tokens can be redeemed for 1 sUSD apiece, or else the sOPT-LONG tokens are worth $0. Any sOPT-LONG or sOPT-SHORT token can only ever reach a final value of 1 sUSD or 0 sUSD. If Alice’s sOPT-LONG tokens are worth 1 sUSD, Alice has 6 months to exercise the sOPT and claim her sUSD.",

            "thirdA": "Binary options are priced based on the make-up of the pool for a given market. The market originator sets an initial skew to establish initial odds, bidders can then choose a side they think is more likely, and during the trading phase a user Alice can set her own prices at which to exchange an sOPT token.",
