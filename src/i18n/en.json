However, even if all options on one side are bought from the AMM, more liquidity will be made available as soon as a trader buys options of the opposite position.</0><0>Thales' AMM only supports trading on a market with calculated odds via BlackScholes above 10% and below 90% and up to 24 hours before market maturity to avoid edge cases and last-minute frontrunning.</0><0>More information about the AMM can be found here: </0><1 />"
