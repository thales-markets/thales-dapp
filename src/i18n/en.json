        "intro": "You can now <b>obtain sUSD</b>, the main stablecoin used for trading on Thales, on Optimism <b>with your Credit Card</b> using MtPelerin integration and following the step-by-step onboarding wizard.<br/><br/>Currently Thales supports the Ethereum main net, Optimism, and Polygon network (these last two are Ethereum scaling solutions, also called Layer-2 networks).<br/><br/>Both of the supported Layer-2 networks, Optimism and Polygon, have significantly lower transaction fees than Ethereum main net.<br/><br/>For the purpose of this guide we’ll be focusing on the Optimism network. If you want to use the Polygon network the process is the same but you’ll need to obtain USDC instead of sUSD.<br/><br/>For trading on Thales markets you will need a few prerequisites:<br/>1. Have a Metamask wallet on your browser<br/>2. Connect to Optimism<br/>3. Buy Ethereum (ETH)<br/>4. Buy sUSD or exchange some Ethereum (ETH) for it<br/><br/>After these steps, you'll be ready to use all our products.<br/><br/><i>Let's start!</i>",

        "step3-name": "Swap to stablecoin",
        "step4-name": "Trade on Thales",
        "step1-0": "The first step is to <b>install Metamask on your browser</b>. You can skip this step if you already have it installed.<br/><br/>This step provides you with your own Ethereum 'Hot Wallet' which is a baseline for all interactions with the Web3 applications in the likes of Thales. Please make sure to <b>follow all steps provided by Metamask install wizard carefully, and read the safety tips with full attention</b>.",
        "step1-1": "After you install it you’ll need to “connect” your Metamask wallet. To do this follow the link by <b>clicking on the Metamask icon on the connect wallet card</b>.<br/><br/>In this case, as we are using the Optimism network as an example, you’ll need to connect your wallet and select the Optimism network.",
        "step2": "Congratulations you have a web3 wallet!<br/><br/>The second step is to obtain Ethereum (ETH) on Optimism using your credit card with the integrated <b>'Fiat to Crypto' on-ramp</b>. If you completed the first step to set up a new Metamask wallet, you would need to use the same wallet's address for the deposit of the purchased Ethereum.<br/><br/>Use our handy on-ramp by <b>clicking on the card icon</b>. You can use any major card provider. Just follow the steps and if you need additional help you can read our documentation or watch the video that explains all the required steps.",
        "step3": "The third step is to <b>exchange some of your acquired Ethereum (ETH) for sUSD</b>, the decentralized stablecoin that is used for trading on Thales, or if you prefer for either USDT, USDC, or DAI (which are all also currently supported on Thales).<br/><br/>You’ll need <b>Ethereum (ETH) to pay for transaction fees on the Optimism network</b>, so make sure to always have some.<br/><br/>And the <b>sUSD will be used to acquire positional tokens (UP or DOWN, IN or OUT)</b> when participating in Thales directional or ranged markets.<br/><br/>When you have Ethereum (ETH) and sUSD in your wallet, you are ready for the final step!<br/><br/><i>Note: If you already have any other supported cryptocurrencies you can exchange them for sUSD with our in-built swap functionality or in any of the major decentralized exchanges like 1Inch.exchange or Uniswap.</i>",

        "question1": "What is Web3?",
        "answer1": "Web3 is the next great development in the internet, with a focus on decentralization and community governance and inclusion, that hopes to shape the future of both the financial and culture world. Blockchains, like Ethereum, are at the core of Web3 infrastructure due to its permissionless nature.",
        "question2": "What is a wallet?",
        "answer2": "A wallet is software that manages an address on a blockchain.  This includes stewardship of an address's private key and allows users to interact with decentralized apps (dApps).",
        "question3": "What is Metamask?",
        "answer3": "Metamask is a popular Web3 wallet developed by ConsenSys that allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain (as well as Ethereum’s Layer 2 networks).  Users can install a desktop browser extension or mobile app for iOS or Android.",
        "question4": "What is sUSD?",
        "answer4": "sUSD is the native stablecoin of the Synthetix ecosystem.  A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that intends to mirror the price of the US dollar and is typically backed by a form of collateral.  sUSD is backed by the SNX token, which is used to “mint” sUSD, and is typically overcollateralized by 3 to 4 times the value of sUSD minted.  sUSD is the main form of collateral used by Thales Market, but other stable coins like USDT, USDC, and DAI are also supported.",
        "question5": "What is a fiat On-Ramp?",
        "answer5": "A fiat On-Ramp is a tool that allows users to exchange fiat currency, such as the US dollar, for cryptocurrency.  Companies offer to deposit cryptocurrency into a user's wallet once they’ve received a deposit of fiat currency from the user.  This allows the user to participate in Web3 applications.",
        "question6": "What are transaction costs?",
        "answer6": "To interact with the Ethereum blockchain (or one of its Layer 2 networks), users must pay a fee.  Each transaction or interaction that takes place on a blockchain must be included in a newly mined block and space within each block is limited.  To ensure a fair and efficient market, users must pay a market rate for each interaction using “gas”, which is a denomination of ETH.  The market rate for the amount of gas required will fluctuate with demand, and different types of interactions require different amounts of gas, depending on the computation load of the interaction.",
        "question7": "What is Ethereum mainnet?",
        "answer7": "Ethereum mainnet is the primary blockchain used to record interactions and balance for the Ethereum network.  There are several networks in use, including the Kovan testnet for testing and development, and Layer 2 networks like Optimism, that act as scaling solutions for the main blockchain.  Mainnet is used to store monetary value on the Etherum blockchain.",
        "question8": "What is Optimism?",
        "answer8": "Optimism is a Layer 2 network that works with Ethereum as a scaling solution.  Ethereum’s mainnet can become congested and expensive to transact with during periods of heavy usage, so the Optimism network has been deployed as a second layer “on top” of Ethereum’s mainnet.  Optimism uses different mechanisms to record transactions than mainnet, but it still utilizes the superior security and network effect of mainnet operating with much lower costs and faster processing speeds.",
        "question9": "What is the Polygon network?",
        "answer9": "The Polygon network is another type of scaling solution used in tandem with Ethereum’s mainnet.  Polygon can still be accessed using Metamask, but the network uses it’s own token, MATIC, as the native token for processing transactions instead of ETH like Ethereum mainnet and Optimism.",
        "question10": "What other platforms support sUSD?",
        "answer10": "Many protocols, both originating from the Synthetix platform and other completely unrelated to Synthetix, utilize sUSD as a form of collateral because of its level of decentralization and overcollateralized backing.  Protocols such as Kwenta, Lyra, and dHedge use sUSD, and you can acquire it from most mainstream DEXs (decentralized exchanges) such as Uniswap or 1inch.",
        "question11": "What is a bridge?",
        "answer11": "A bridge is a tool used to transfer cryptocurrency from one blockchain network to another.  For example, a user might exchange fiat currency for ETH using a centralized tool, which will deposit the asset on Ethereum’s mainnet.  The user can then “bridge” this ETH to another network, such as Optimism or Polygon, using a bridge.",
        "question12": "What is a Parimutuel Market?",
        "answer12": "A Parimutuel Market is a type of market that creates a shared pool of collateral and awards winning positions with a proportional share of the entire pool minus market fees. A market-settling event for a Parimutuel market can be one of two mutually exclusive outcomes (e.g. Thales Positional Markets like the UP or DOWN and IN or OUT markets), or it can be one of many mutually exclusive outcomes (e.g. Thales Exotic Market with multiple positions).",
        "question13": "What are Directional Markets?",
        "question13-link-text": "watch video",
        "answer13": "Directional markets, also called UP and DOWN markets, allow traders to purchase a position in relation to the price of an asset versus a target price (strike price) at a time (maturity date/time).  Traders can purchase a position based on a specific strike price at a certain time, and if they choose the correct direction (above/UP or below/DOWN) in relation to the assets actual price at the time of maturity, they can claim winnings.  For example, a trader might believe that ETH will end up above $1200 on April 12th, so they could find a directional market with a strike price of $1200 and a maturity date of April 12 and purchase UP tokens for this market.  If ETH does end up above $1200 on 4/12, then the trader could exercise their UP tokens and receive sUSD.",
        "question14": "What are Ranged Markets?",
        "question14-link-text": "watch video",
        "answer14": "Ranged Markets are similar to Directional Markets, but instead of using a single strike price, they utilize a “range” of prices, and traders can purchase IN or OUT positions in relation to this range.  For example, a trader can purchase an IN position for an ETH ranged market from 1000-1200, and if the price of ETH ends up within this range at the time of maturity, the trader can claim their winnings.",
        "question15": "What are Positional Tokens?",
        "answer15": "Positional Tokens are a form of digital asset stored on the blockchain and is used to represent positions in Directional (UP or DOWN positional tokens) and Ranged Markets (IN or OUT positional tokens).  Users can purchase a position for one of these markets by exchanging collateral for a positional token.  For example, if a trader wants to take a position for a ranged market stating that the price of the asset will end up outside of the specified range, they will purchase an OUT positional token.  If the trader is successful, they can exchange their positional token upon maturity for a certain amount of winnings.",
        "question16": "Which crytocurrencies are supported?",
        "answer16": "Thales Market currently uses sUSD as the main form of collateral when purchasing positions, but other stable coins are also utilized.  These include USDC, USDT and DAI.",

Born out of the Synthetix ecosystem, Thales leverages ChainLink provided price feeds, 0x limit order books, and the sUSD stablecoin to provide participants a novel on-chain, permissionless, and non-custodial way to participate in the price movement of crypto assets and certain non-crypto assets."

Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives experienced tremendous growth, notably in the form of perpetual swaps and vanilla options on centralized platforms. With a high counter-party risk of centralized solutions, the need for trustless, self-custodied, decentralized crypto asset derivative products is clear. Thales’ goal is to contribute to alleviating this need by providing participants a novel on-chain, permissionless, versatile, and non-custodial derivative protocol.",
                    "section2": "Thales enables participants to take part in price movement or certain on-chain outcomes of supported assets around available on-chain data feeds. Thales accomplishes this by utilizing its own parimutuel markets mechanism. These parimutuel markets are deployable by any user and are collateralized by uncensorable and decentralized stablecoin sUSD, the flagship product of Synthetix. These markets are deployed with custom strike threshold and maturity date, allowing unprecedented versa-\ntility. The majority of on-chain data feeds used by Thales parimutuel markets stem from Chainlink and are used as immutable sources of truth for market settlement.",

In the event of a front-end not being functional for whatever reason, a user could always interact with the Thales smart contracts directly."

The definition of Parimutuel Market is a market where collateral is placed in a pool and final payout to participants is not determined until the market-settling event is finalized. By leveraging the secure, permissionless and non-custodial nature of Ethereum smart contracts, every participant is able to form a Thales parimutuel market around supported assets with custom parameters and every participant is able to participate in any formed Thales parimutuel market. Other than versatility and openness, when compared to other trading platforms, Thales parimutuel markets have the benefits of a limited risk environment. With capped downside and capped upside, both calculable from the start, participants are exposed to an easily understandable and familiar way to take advantage of various assets’ price- movements (or lack thereof).",

Depending on how this market’s particular event manifests in reality, the smart contracts underlying a Parimutuel Market will autonomously and independently execute according to the rules and terms established from the aggregated activity of the relevant Market Participants.",
                    "section3": "While Thales is ideal for creating Parimutuel Markets for events related to price movements of crypto-assets, the protocol is not limited solely to such use and, theoretically, Parimutuel Markets may be introduced for any type of off-chain event. Further, some crypto-assets that are not natively tracked by the Ethereum blockchain (such as BTC) may also form the basis for Parimutuel Market events. This is accomplished by utilizing a network-authenticated reference data providers of information that can be read and processed on the blockchain, called ”oracles”. Given Thales’ goal of a system without a specific, discrete, and unilateral point of failure, the protocol relies on the ChainLink decentralized oracle solution project to provide this information.",
                    "section4": "Parimutuel Markets on Thales are formed by Market Creators who set the parameters of the market as they see fit. For market creation, they are given a list of supported assets to choose from and are free to manually input the Strike Price and Maturity Date (including a specific Time) for this new market. Market Creator is also entailed to deposit initial collateral for this new market for which he receives proportional positional tokens.",
                    "section5": "Assets pooled by market makers into market pools are used as collateral that secures the minted Positional Tokens. Each unit of collateral deposited mints an equal number of each positional tokens that represent positions in a particular parimutuel market. There are two distinct types of Positional Tokens: those where a Participant’s position is insured in the case the market determining event occurs positively, and those where a Participant’s position is insured in the case the same event occurs negatively. Only the holders of one of the types of Positional Tokens will receive coverage according to their claims."

Synthetix is an open-source project that provides crypto-assets (namely, the Synths) whose value tracks that of Reference Assets without the need of a centralized authority or intermediary. Minting sUSD as a synth is functionally equivalent to issuing a fiat-denominated liability against the liquid market value of the ERC-20 collateral, denominated in “SNX,” the crypto-asset native to Synthetix. Holding sUSD is much safer for users who wish to avoid censorship risks, frustrations associated with traditional banking or financial services, associated with temporary geographical location, and the volatility inherent in many other crypto-assets. sUSD is overcollateralized several times, meaning there is anywhere from 4–7 times worth of SNX collateral backing the fiat value of each sUSD. This approach is intended to preemptively mitigate aforementioned risks before they manifest and causes Synthetix to achieve its mission towards stable sUSD value. Further, the fully developed use cases designed around sUSD enable the Protocol to function smoothly for the foreseeable future. There’s no way to stop one person from sending another person sUSD. Similarly, there is no way to stop a participant from minting Positional Tokens on Thales with sUSD and there is no way to stop a participant from exercising his winning Positional Tokens for sUSD. In the event of a front-end not being functional for whatever reason, a user could always interact with the Thales smart contracts directly through a blockchain explorer."

Currently there are two distinct types of Positional Tokens: those which insure a position in case a certain market event resolves positively and those which insure a position in case a market event resolves negatively. These Positional Tokens are minted by Market Creators and Market Makers. When forming a market, Market Creator needs to deposit sufficient collateral to cover both ends of the market. This collateral is locked in that specific market’s smart contract, which proportionally mints both types of the Positional Tokens. The amount of Positional Tokens minted corresponds to the amount of collateral deposited, so only one side of the tokens (the winning side) will be able to redeem the collateral in 1:1 ratio, while the other side will be deemed worthless. Market Creators are not the only participants who provide collateral. Other participants, the Market Makers, may also provide additional sUSD collateral to increase the pool size and subsequently mint Positional Tokens for that specific Parimutuel Market. The only technical difference between Market Makers and Market Creator is that Market Creators initiated a relevant Pool’s creation. As Market Makers mint positional tokens on a market initiated by a particular Market Creator, that Market Creator will receive a part of fees assessed on those transactions while the rest of the fees are allocated towards the ThalesDAO fee pool."

The collateral deposited is used to facilitate trading on Thales' AMM.</p><p>To be able to provide liquidity you'll need to be staking THALES. There's no maximum cap per wallet and you may deposit a maximum of 1 {{currency}} per {{thalesStakedAmount}} THALES staked until the liquidity pool is filled.</p><p>At the end of each round, the proportional share of that round's PnL will be added to your deposited balance.</p><p>If you wish to withdraw, you can signal that at any time during the ongoing round, and at the end of the round the amount you signaled for withdrawal (inclusive of that round's PnL) is sent to you. The minimum amount to be withdrawn is set to 10%.</p><p>If you decide to unstake THALES while providing liquidity, please be aware that you'll need to signal a withdrawal from the liquidity pool first.</p><p>Providing liquidity exposes you to various risks including potential losses due to users winning in trading as well as smart contract security risks. Please make sure you understand these risks before depositing.</p><p><tipLink>TIP-139</tipLink> has more details on the technical implementation of Thales AMM liquidity providing.</p>",
