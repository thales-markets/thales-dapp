    "milkywave": "That was an intense epoch. Loads of discussions, proposals, TIPs, changes and in my opinion, overall another very successful period for Thales. Many thanks to the current council, I think we've done a great job!\n\nI nominate myself for another epoch. As before, I hope for the next era to have a council that can engage in controversial discussions, be open to new ideas, while remaining true to itself and maintaining a friendly demeanor.\nI'll contribute and keep considering diverse community viewpoints in my decision-making, bringing forth numerous new ideas (even if I get criticized – that's the deal).\n\nThe new epoch will bring us excitement but also challenges. Whether it's the launch on Base (and yes, I'm giga bullish forThales on Base),\nSpongly🧽 , potential LP ungating or other significant governance discussions/decisions that shouldn't be underestimated.\n\nI can promise to continue being open to compromises in decision-making, actively participating, while also standing my ground on my viewpoints, just as I have done before.\n\nI would be happy if you give me the chance to be one of your council members again :pepebusiness:  ! Ride the Milkywave with me 🥛 🌊 .\n\nLast but not least: I lost my bet OT on OP > AMM on OP before mid year - but that's okay, sometimes you lose, sometimes you win.

I hope that many more TIPs will be created in the future from our community.\nI do think we can still find areas for improvement to involve community even more in future developments.\n\nThe next epoch looks very promising, between the release of new products (Speed Markets), the launch of several third-party projects (Spongly), the deployment on new chains (Base) and the overhaul of several aspects of tokenomics.\n\nThis highly skilled CCs team and their ability to deliver reliable, innovative products time and time again continue to impress me and make me even more confident and bullish for the future.\n\nI decided to run again because I think I still have valuable contributions to offer and I'm extremely motivated to continue helping Thales move forward!\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nENS: 0xsvenska.eth\n@CT: 0xsvenska",
    "fhd": "Hi,\n\nI've been pushing for key changes in Thales Tokenomics for a while now, and will continue to do so.\n\nI am very active and up to date with almost all things DeFi related, you can find me on twitter here: https://twitter.com/0xfhd_\n\n My ideal version of Thales would:\n - no longer incentivize staking, as it is an ancient means of keeping users locked in for no reason\n - ungate our product's AMM's and go hard on buyback and burn, until revenues are sizeable enough for rev share\n - minimize thales/eth and thales/usdc incentives as much as possible\n\nOverall, I would not support anything that helps users farm and dump thales. I would focus on increasing the number of reasons to be a Thales holder, and not a farmer.\n\nIf you'd like Thales to go deflationary, please vote for me!\n\n0xfhd.eth",

I’m active on CT as https://twitter.com/realpennybags (primarily lurking atm during the bear but looking to ramp up on content over the next few months).\n\nTbf, this would be the first time I’m nominating myself to be part of a DAO gov council, despite my familiarity with how DAOs and the governance process generally operates. Am motivated to become more involved this time because I’m a huge believer that Thales have the right narratives to succeed in the coming bull cycle (gamblefi + op/base l2 supercycle), and I’d like to help voice and steer this boat towards the right direction.\n\nMost people who have worked w me say I’m particularly good at narrative building and things that are analytical-related - mostly because I have a mind for naïveté and knowing what is the perfect end-goal, yet at the same time am willing to compromise when the trade off is too high (ie. when cost benefit isn’t worth).\n\nLast but not least, fwiw, I actively gamble on thales amm and am prolly one of the top donatooors to thales lpooors (I haven't checked).\n\nENS: pennybags.eth\nBeacon url: https://degenscore.com/beacon/0x4026b3Da349C2952255Ca9db4F055ea57F4e037C \nNansen wallet profiler: https://pro.nansen.ai/wallet-profiler?address=0x4026b3Da349C2952255Ca9db4F055ea57F4e037C",
    "BigPenny": "Hello my fellow Thales Chads!\n\nI can't believe it's already election season! Considering the number of TIPs that have been proposed and passed, it makes sense though. We've made significant progress in making Thales and Overtime the one-stop-shop for everything Sports and Crypto gaming. My favorite feature of this era is the Speed Markets, which are expected to go live very soon. The overhaul of our tokenomics (TIP-163) is really exciting and was a great demonstration of our ability to adapt as needed.\n\nMy strengths lie in fast-paced games, and with the successful beta test of Speed Markets, we have opened up many new possibilities for Thales. One of the more obvious opportunities is integrating Speed Markets into Telegram bots and other types of automated gaming systems. Additionally, Speed Markets can serve as a complimentary feature for other protocols that offer crypto-based gaming and do not want to deal with the hassle of building the required infrastructure. Thales and Overtime are not fully using their potential to serve as the backend for third-party protocols. However, I am certain that this will change soon. We are already creating advanced game modes for Speed Markets, such as chaining positions for higher multipliers. I am currently exploring ideas on how to build on our existing Speed Market model. This could involve implementing it into other products, or expanding on the idea for augmented gaming experiences. The simplicity and fast pace of Speed Markets offer a range of possibilities.\n\nAnother significant topic is tokenomics. TIP-163 is an important first step, but depending on how Thales (both the protocol and the token) performs, further adjustments will be necessary in the future. Going deflationary is on the board and at the very least we will increase BBB significantly the more Thales and Overtime pick up in volume. My goal is to make staking a lasting profitable occupation.\n\nI am nominating myself for the Thales Council because I want to continue guiding important decisions and steer Thales towards a profitable and successful future. As one of the largest Stakers, I have a strong interest in the success of the Protocol. I’m never shy to voice my opinion and I know how to stand my ground for the community.\n\nI'm excited to have your support!\n\nENS: bigpenny.eth",
    "hofer7": "Hi All,\n\nFirstly, thanks for @Danijel | Thales for the gentle nudge to put myself forward for consideration.\n\nI have been in this space since 2018 on and off. I first discovered Thales about 18 months ago in my search for the ability to bet on sports onchain. In that time, I have absolutely loved watching Thales and Overtime grow an awesome community and implement innovative product improvements (parlays on Overtime are my favorite). As a Thales Olympian, I am passionate about helping Thales continue to grow in terms of community, actual users and profitability.\n\nIn RL, I wear many hats for a SaaS company including product innovation, business\\product\\user growth and BA work. I love being in the position of sitting 'somewhere in the middle' between a technical development team and not-so-technical end users as I am able to help with developing a strategic approach to achieving overall growth, making decisions on product innovation and understanding the wants and needs of a community. I feel I could utilize these skills to help Thales make the right decisions to continue to evolve to become a major player in this space.\n\nI am an active staker, LPer, Vault-er (not sure if that’s a word), Discord community member and most importantly - user of the protocol, and I would be thrilled to be considered as a council member.\n\nENS: hofer7.eth",
    "tumilet": "Hey guys tumilet / José here,\n\nFirst a quick description about me: 23yo from Spain that just graduated this year from college from a Law and BBA degree and is currently working on the hedge fund team at Spartan on Hong Kong. I do crypto liquid investing and have great knowledge of all things DeFi. I´m also a power user of sportsbetting and recently discovered Overtime Markets. The product is great, I think it has some improvements left and would really like to contribute with feedback and votes to make it better, from the bettor´s `POV.\n\nI also love valuation and finance (you could think this could not be very related to thales), and I think it would be great to have a member on the Council that is close to investing frameworks and that is close with some fundamental liquid funds. Thales product has a very clear PMF, and if we can achieve a greater number of usage, the growth of the protocol will be exponential (and very “lucrative”). So I can also deliver from the investor or holder´s POV.\n\nWith this info, I´m nominating myself. I hold 30% of my portfolio in $THALES and will continue buying at these prices, so I´m very aligned with THALES future and value prop.\n\nENS (and main wallet): tumilet.eth\nTW: https://twitter.com/tumilett",

That was after being a dedictated community member in both SNX and Thales discords in the early days. Governance is something special that Thales does really well and that brings the most passionate members of Thales together. I am nominating myself once again to be part of the 7 members of the council. My focus will as always be the community and to represent you.\n\nVoted in or not, I am really looking forward to this election and I am absolutely loving all the nominations so far.

    "trades3": "Greetings Esteemed Citizens of Thales,\n\nI humbly present myself as a nominee for the council, driven by a singular aim: the enhancement and evolution of the Thales protocol.\n\nCurrent State of Thales:\n\nThales, in my perspective, is very undervalued. However, I think this provides benefit and opportunity. As new users engage with the protocol, they see the value inherent in it. We have an extremely talented group of CC's, who are actively working to improve the protocol and ship new features. From Speed Markets to the Tale of Thales, the CC's are doing impressive work.\n\nAn Optimal Council:\n\nI envision council members fostering a circular feedback loop which builds upon the previous councils work to increase TIP participation:\nDevelopers Innovate -> Users Engage -> Community Grows -> Feedback Guides -> Renewed Innovation\n\nI pledge to support TIPS which increase the value of every participants user experience - from CC's, to brand new users, to the active community member. This involves actively sourcing feedback and participating in constructive discussions\n\nI believe for a long-term outlook, the fundamentals matter the most. I would favor actions that have long term growth over short term wins.\n\nMy background:\n\nMy day job is a developer for a dev agency. I am actively increasing my knowledge around Solidity and the EVM. I believe this knowledge will be useful for evaluating TIPS and the impact they will have on the protocol.\n\nMy Thales background:\n\nI was introduced to Thales via the Thales Royale. My belief remains: Thales is destined for greatness.\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, it will be my honor to serve on the council. I look forward to serving the Thales protocol.\n\n0xC14e44730e26e88EF833d1c45CbDA5e7A4fa7603",

The new tokenomics overhaul is a great step in this direction, and I’ll be supporting similar initiatives to align incentives to the benefit of all $THALES holders.\n\nI'm particularly excited about opportunities to drive more core product usage and broaden our community.\n\nWhether in council or not, you'll continue to find me promoting our products and community across the crypto landscape. Thales remains far and away my largest position (together with the ETH I LP with), and the only protocol whose governance I partake in, so I can promise voters my fullest attention and a borderline irresponsible amount of skin in the game.\n\nWe keep making progress and with a host of new products, chains deployed, front-ends, and top notch community members, the near-term opportunity for Thales is immense.\n\nWallet: 0x9eFa2B1E4C5D6443D302f68EF9e32E8666673bE5",

It is great to know that Thales will stay in good hands.\n\nMost of you probably know me, but for those who don’t, here is a quick introduction.\nI have been a Thales core contributor for almost 2 years now, and have been a part of some of the previous Thales councils.\nBefore Web3, I worked in corporate IT for 5 years. At Thales, I make sure that the existing and new features work as intended, and play the bridge between the users and the dev team.\n\nCompared to some of the previous epochs, I think we now truly have a mature product that is ready for mainstream adoption. We have pretty much all of the core features working as intended, have willing LPs due to the proven performance of the AMMs, and have some fun new products and functionalities coming.\n\nFor this epoch, I would push mostly integrations and partnerships with relevant projects, integrators and networks. Internally, I have been picking up the BD part of Thales step by step and will continue to do so. I truly think we are in a good spot right now, and I am very excited about the next couple of months for Thales.\n\nIf you share the same vision for Thales as me, it would be my honor to once again be a part of the council.
