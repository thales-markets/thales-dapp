First thanks to the first OC! I think you/we did a great job!\n\nI would like to summarize my highlights of the first epoch as part of the OC:\n -Preparation for launch, tested different scenarios, fixed small inconsistencies, adapt guidelines\n -Launch on April 27th 2022 :lfg:\n -Fast processing of the disputes that have arisen\n -Actively supported the community in creating new markets and general questions\n\n The first 3 months I would definitely call the 'teaching phase' and in my opinion:\n a) the understanding of the exotic markets has increased massively\n b) the quality of the new markets has increased\n c) the oracle council has done an excellent job, especially concerning the reaction time!\n\n I think I can make an important contribution in the Oracle Council and I am convinced that the exotic markets will really take off in the next 6 months. Therefore I would like to nominate myself again for the OC election and would be happy to get your vote!\n Cheers ü•õ üåä",
    "Weston Nelson": "Greetings to everyone here in the Assembly of Thales. I am feeling quite enthusiastic and honored to have been nominated for the responsibility and opportunity to potentially join the Oracle Council! \n\nA sincere thank you to @BigPenny :thales_blue: \n\nFor my pitch: I wanted to share a little background about me, why I believe I would be an excellent fit contributing in this manner, and last, my qualifications and skills I can bring to Thales to support growth.\n\nTo start, wanted to mention I just get a really great vibe from the community here and this is an intangible thing but one I felt worth mentioning for sure. I have seen a lot, and It feels like one of the best in crypto and I LIKE IT! Contributing more to that would be a huge joy to me as I love promoting DeFi and especially novel/new primitives like Thales and Exotic Markets. I believe strongly that small groups of people can do massively large things with focus and determination, and this is something I see happening with Thales. \n\nMy qualifications: Over 10 years experience in financial markets. Started my career in TradFi as a Financial Advisor‚Ä¶I would say I learned the most from the couple years I spent with Fidelity Investments, where I worked as an Investment Consultant. I have a thorough and deep understanding of derivatives, trading strategies, and crypto assets. I have been full-time in crypto for the past 2+ years primarily just trading crypto and researching markets and more recently, learning to write code in order to trade programatically. \n\nI think the Oracle Council is a natural fit for me when considering the architecture of Exotic Markets. I feel this role would ideally be made up of people who are reasonable, open-minded and can demonstrate sound judgment in sometimes very gray areas, which can be tough; and I think this is one of my strengths that I can bring to Thales in terms of resolving disputes, moderating Markets, and ensuring the health of Exotics is watched over with a close eye.\n\nIf I were to be elected to the Oracle Council I would do my best to go above and beyond  to contribute to Thales success by success by utilizing the unique package of skills I‚Äôve acquired over the years in traditional finance, decentralized finance, community building, smart contract security and development, trading and tokenomic design, and researching the overall crypto landscape‚Ä¶ and strive to bring as much traction as I possibly can to Thales to positive benefit all parties involved. \n\nMy intentions long term are to be a top notch smart contract developer and so this also aligns very well I believe. I also have enjoyed being a part of this community, the Royales, holding an up position on Luna on May 12th, and chatting with everyone in here has been awesome - feels like the right place for me to contribute and I would feel it to be a true privilege for me to be become a member of the Oracle Council.\n\nI also would like to nominate @BigPenny for Thales Council, @Red | Thales for Thales Council and @milkywave (ü•õüåä) for Oracle Council. I am super pumped for Thales, Exotic Markets, and see immense potential here to build. The crew seems nimble and sharp, and dedicated to all the right things, which I value very much.\n\nSincerely,\n\nWeston Nelson \nWallet: westonnelson.eth",
    "raffiegang": "Hello fellow gambl<oops>positionors!\n\nFor those that already know me: üèùÔ∏è I‚Äôm just an island boiii  üèùÔ∏è, for those who don‚Äôt: I‚Äôm raffie, Thales OG, and fanboy from the start. I‚Äôm involved and interested in anything Synthetix related.\n\nI‚Äôve already had the honor to serve this epoch as a member of the OC :crystalball:  , and in that time I have learned a great deal (shout out to my fellow OC members) about the subtle art of exotic market making and dispute resolution... And either despite or because having served before, I‚Äôd love to bring it again for the following epoch. \n\nServing for me means, I‚Äôll be:\n\n- having an eye on markets and their integrity; \n- resolving disputes asap;\n- striving to create or helping create the first open bid market that will explode volume wise;\n- helping out wherever I can in other areas; for example through building something (this epoch I built an URL malware check solution for exotic market data sources - still to be deployed)\n\nGood luck to everyone running!

    "DeFiCandy": "Hello my friends, \n\nFirst a BIG thank you to those that urged me to run for Oracle Council. I wouldn‚Äôt be writing this without your support.\n\nWho am I? Well, despite being pseudo-anon (doxxed to Thales team member), I‚Äôll share a bit about myself. IRL I‚Äôm a motion graphics artist and entrepreneur. In English that means I work on designing and animating movie titles as well as graphic animations and VisualFX for commercials, video games, etc. I have served as Art Director for one of the major broadcast corporations and have also built my own boutique motion graphics agency (which I‚Äôve since sold because of client headaches and I just love creating). I‚Äôve also played sports, mostly hockey, my entire life and love anything related to sports numbers and prognostication. From creating my own prediction models to good ol fantasy football, sports + numbers fascinates me. So what‚Äôs this got to do w crypto? Well, nothing, I was just telling you about myself IRL. BUT, my love for design and sports are not my only passions. My other passion is in numbers and logic, hence crypto. I was first introduced to crypto around the 2017/18 bull-run. I was intrigued by Synthetix and then found the Synthetix Discord and ‚ÄúDegen-Trading‚Äù channel and knew I was home lol. Seriously though, I found the ethos of DeFi to be SO refreshing. Seeing communities working together to build a level financial playing field honestly restored my hope for humanity. I‚Äôve met so many amazing people and groups over the years but none have compared to the Synthetix family. As I‚Äôve recently ‚Äúcome back‚Äù and gotten more involved with Thales it‚Äôs been heartwarming to see so many old familiar names from the community now in governance. It truly is a governance of the people, as it should be. It feels like destiny that this community I love has evolved into Exotic Markets and is about to launch Overtime, a product so similar to a vision I had years ago that I‚Äôve never let go‚Ä¶\n\nSo beyond the amazing community, the other aspect of this that really excites me is that I had a vision of a DeFi sportsbook back in 2018 when I was first learning how block-chains work. It was a lightbulb moment where I realized that with the use of this new technology, one could create a sports prediction market with almost no juice‚Ä¶ It would be very possible to offer the BEST odds, and if that's not enough, the players could possibly get any kickback that the protocol does make! Win-win-win! I followed projects like Auger for a bit as they tried to build something like this vision, but nobody was able to create it. It was a bit shocking to me. In the meantime, sports betting has absolutely exploded! (at least/especially in the US). US News reports Americans have bet 125 Billion dollars over the past four years‚Ä¶  And guess what, we can still use our on-chain advantage to beat the companies like Draft Kings and Fanduel who are taking most of this profit. So yea, I‚Äôm really really excited about this protocol to say the least.\n\nI‚Äôve always thought of myself as a small fish in the crypto world. This is partly why I never expected to be running for a governing role. However, I‚Äôm realizing I have been in this game for a little while now and I should be a bit more confident in myself. I‚Äôll always be the first person to admit what I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm not afraid to ask basic questions and admit when I‚Äôm wrong or uninformed. These values should transfer well to a governing role. I‚Äôve also gone over the Oracle Council responsibilities a few times and I know that I could meet and hopefully go beyond the expectations set there. With this background of sports prognostication, DeFi, and some high end marketing, I would be honored to serve on the Oracle Council and do everything I can to ensure we have the best markets possible, driven by the community.\n\nI will always make myself as open and available as possible. I will always act in the community's best interest. I would be honored to get your vote and take on this responsibility as an Oracle Council member. I sincerely thank you for reading this and please don‚Äôt hesitate to ask if you have any further questions.\n\nCheers!",
    "MiLLiŒû": "Hey everyone,\n\n I'm going to nominate myself once again for the Oracle Council! It has been a pleasure to serve for the past epoch among the other council members and I can't even begin to say how impressed I am with the efforts of all Thales contributors over the past several months.\n\n During the first epoch I felt like I was able to bring a lot to the table and help Exotics get off the ground, particularly in the pre-launch and early beta-phases. Since it's inception Exotic markets has had some great improvements that made for a better user experience and more robust mechanics. There's still lot's of work left to be done however, and I'd like to see Exotic markets reach a level of scalability and adoption that makes it a strong competitor in the industry. \n\nFor the next epoch I'd like to continue helping Exotics improve and continue monitoring disputes to ensure the mechanism is functioning as it should be. Additionally I want to help usage of Exotic markets really ramp up and see the $OP distribution that will be allocated for it to be used efficiently in bootstrapping campaigns until we get there. \n\n I have many ideas I think we can explore with Exotics and I'm excited for the opportunity to be involved with it's growth! \n\n Cheers fellow Greeks, thank you all for your support so far and going forward! \n0xmillie.eth",
    "Cvija | Thales": "Hello friends, it is my pleasure to write here again. \n\nI am sure more of you got to know me since my last pitch, but I will try to sum it up once again.\n\nMy name is Cvija (tsweeiya), and I am a Core Contributor at Thales. I am also a member of the first elected Oracle Council, serving with four other friends from our community, which has been an absolute pleasure.\n\nSome short info about me:\nMy background is mostly Software Quality, working with development teams on complex financial products, handling and prioritizing new features and improvements, and getting familiar with the product and industry as deep as possible.\n\nAt Thales, I have a similar role (I also do some shitposting, yes :kek:), but what I feel like is different here is the direct and spontaneous connection with all the community members, people willing to give you honest and helpful feedback and ideas with the common goal of improving the protocol.\n\nThis has been the case especially for the Exotic markets, because the mechanism behind them is kinda new, and all kinds of unforeseen situations could have come up.\n\nAs a member of the Oracle Council, I think we as a team did a pretty good job - helping out with testing new features, with writing the guidelines, giving feedback on possible markets, and most importantly - handling disputes in a very timely fashion and in complete agreement. \n\nWhat gives me the confidence that Exotics will succeed is a slow but reliable influx of new community members, showing passions and willingness to take on responsibility, be it in promoting, creating markets or offering their help in other ways. The other thing is that we are all aware that we cannot stop here and that we need to continue to build, promote, incentivize and deliver, regardless of the current market situation.\n\nUsing my close involvement with both the other team members and the community, my main goal continues to be taking the platform to a whole another level, and I would be honored try and do this as an Oracle Council member once more.\n\nThanks everyone! \n\nENS: cvija.eth ",
    "JVK": "This is my TC self nomination.  My public wallet is jvk.eth.\n\nI was active on the OG Thales discord but lately less active here as I was occupied with being a new SC (Spartan Council) member and being involved at another DAO as well.\n\nIn governance, I tend to be somewhat conservative and focus on what I view to be the long term health of protocols vs short term gains.\n\nI am generally liberal re things like pursuing partnerships and cross promotion outside of protocols.  I think they need to 'network' just like IRL somewhat.\n\nIn addition to SC, I'm still on council for Kwenta Interim Council too.  However, most of that epoch work is done as we are mainly waiting for DAO launch and new elections there soonthetix.\n\nWhether we are in crypto winter or just a dip it doesn't matter to me that much.  I'm in this for the tech. :)   My day job is a practicing attorney with a background in IT and accounting/finance and my day job even includes crypto/forensics sometimes, which is how I first got exposed to it.  I also  started learning about it through various personal connections who work full time for crypto projects too.\n\nI have always liked Thales and think there is an amazing protocol being built here that needs to find the right audience.  I'd be happy to help make that happen however I can.",
